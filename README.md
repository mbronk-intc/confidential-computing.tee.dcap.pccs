# Intel&reg; SGX/TDX Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (Intel&reg; SGX/TDX PCCS)

## Introduction

This repository hosts two primary components:

| Name                 | Source location                    | Description                                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ***PCCS Service***   | [`./service`](service)             | Node.js REST service for SGX collateral caching                              |
| ***PCCS AdminTool*** | [`./PccsAdminTool`](PccsAdminTool) | Utilities for managing the cached collateral, manual refresh and inspection  |

Together they support Intel&reg; SGX DCAP remote attestation by locally caching provisioning collateral consumed during quote generation *(PCK certificates, PCK certificate chains)* and verification *(TCB info, CRLs, QE/QvE identities, root CAs, appraisal policies)*, reducing latency and external dependencies.

PCCS also caches Intel SGX DCAP provisioning certification collateral (i.e., Platform Manifests), helping centralize the infrastructure set-up as well. For more information, refer to [its README](service/README.md).

For broader DCAP context *(Quote Generation / Verification stacks, QPL, QE/QvE identities)*, see the [DCAP project](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives)
and the [SGX project](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx).
