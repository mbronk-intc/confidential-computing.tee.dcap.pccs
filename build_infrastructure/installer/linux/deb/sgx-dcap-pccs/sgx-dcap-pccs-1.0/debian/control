# ___
# vvv - intel-tee-pccs-admin-tool is a recommended dependency (especially for managing pccs in REQ and OFFLINE modes).
#       While, in some deployments, it is installed on a different host from the PCCS system itself, it is considered
#       a recommendation (weak dependency in RPM parlance) due to the practicality of having it also available on the localhost.
#       Note the reverse is not true: PCCS package is merely a *hint* for intel-tee-pccs-admin-tool.
Recommends: intel-tee-pccs-admin-tool (>= @dep_version@)
